I love programming. I mostly do web development and have released numerous open source modules(http://search.cpan.org/~frew) to make developing web apps easier.

I started programming QBasic for fun in middle school, and quickly got into using unix(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dimension_Fortress) and Perl. When I was in 10th grade I wrote a system for a Pawn Shop to keep track of redemption rates and more using Perl and MySQL.

In college I started using Ruby for personal projects and that is where I got a better understanding of Functional Programming and OO to an extent. About halfway through college I started working with another student on TOME(http://code.google.com/p/ptome), which is a system to help students share books. It was in that context that I learned to do more complex Perl programming as well as lots of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and complex database interactions.

More Recently (See Responsibilities for MTSI below) I've gotten involved in using more complex Perl frameworks, like Catalyst and DBIx::Class. Both of those I've used extensively to the point where I have contributed code to both.

Other
Projects and Links

CPAN modules(http://search.cpan.org/~frew/): well tested, well documented, released code.

github code(http://github.com/frioux): experimental modules that may never actually get released, but still may be worth looking at.
