# Arthur Axel "fREW" Schmidt

I love programming. I mostly do web development and have released numerous
open source [modules](http://search.cpan.org/~frew) to make developing
web apps easier.

I started programming QBasic for fun in middle school, and quickly got
into using [unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dimension_Fortress)
and Perl. When I was in 10th grade I wrote a system for a Pawn Shop to
keep track of redemption rates and more using Perl and MySQL.

In college I started using Ruby for personal projects
and that is where I got a better understanding of
Functional Programming and OO to an extent. About halfway
through college I started working with another student on
[TOME](http://code.google.com/p/ptome/source/list?num=250&start=547),
which is a system to help students share books. It was in that context
that I learned to do more complex Perl programming as well as lots of
Javascript, HTML, CSS, and complex database interactions.

At Micro Technology Services Incorporated I've gotten involved in using
more complex Perl frameworks, like Catalyst and DBIx::Class. Both of those
I've used extensively to the point where I have contributed code to both.  I
convinced the company to start using version control with subversion and helped
the switch to git when it was sufficiently mature for professional usage.

Since my initial hire as a web developer I have moved to an architectural
role, taking the lead on designing a Duress/Mass Notification system
used by most VA Hospitals and many schools across the country.  I am
actively working towards the design of a masterless distributed server
for performance and reliability.

## Open Source

Starting in 2009 I began releasing open source modules on CPAN.
I couldn't list all of my [contributions](https://github.com/frioux)
or [modules](https://metacpan.org/author/FREW) here,
but the most important are probably [my database deployment
tool](https://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler)
(generic enough to have [a popular
tool](https://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class::Migration)
written on top of it), and [my set of ORM
extensions](https://metacpan.org/release/DBIx-Class-Helpers).
Since early 2012 I have released at least [one module a
week](http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/longest) on CPAN.

In addition to producing useful modules for the
community, I have performed at least 60 [git
conversions](https://github.com/frioux/Git-Conversions/), done nearly 6 talks at
conferences ([here are](www.presentingperl.org/yn2010/)
[a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_NlfHNVvg)).
