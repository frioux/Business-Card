I love programming. I mostly do web development and have released numerous
open source [modules](http://search.cpan.org/~frew) to make developing
web apps easier.

I started programming QBasic for fun
in middle school, and quickly got into using
[unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDF_Public_Access_Unix_System)
and Perl. When I was in 10th grade I wrote a system for a Pawn Shop to
keep track of redemption rates and more using Perl and MySQL.

In college I started using Ruby for personal projects
and that is where I got a better understanding of
Functional Programming and OO to an extent. About halfway
through college I started working with another student on
[TOME](http://code.google.com/p/ptome/source/list?num=250&start=547),
which is a system to help students share books. It was in that context
that I learned to do more complex Perl programming as well as lots of
Javascript, HTML, CSS, and complex database interactions.

At Micro Technology Services Incorporated I've gotten involved in using
more complex Perl frameworks, like the Catalyst web framework and the
DBIx::Class ORM. Both of those I've used extensively to the point where
I have contributed code to both.  I convinced MicroTech to start using
version control with subversion and helped the switch to git when it
was sufficiently mature for professional usage.

Since my initial hire as a web developer I have moved to an architectural
role, taking the lead on designing a Duress/Mass Notification system
used by most VA Hospitals and many schools across the country.  I am
actively working towards the design of a masterless distributed server
for performance and reliability.

## Selected Open Source Projects

 * `DBIx::Class`: Perl ORM
 * `Catalyst`: Perl Web Framework
 * `DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler`: Database Deployment/Migration Tool
 * `DBIx::Class::Helpers`: Collection of useful extensions to `DBIx::Class`
 * Over 50 git conversions for a large variety of projects

## Experience

Micro Technology Services Incorporated  
Software Engineer/Architect  
Aug 2008 - Current  
`Perl Apache mod_perl SQLServer DBIx::Class Catalyst CGI::Application ExtJS`
Projects: Lynx (Mass Notification and Duress, Lead Developer), Aircraft Ducting
MRP (Custom MRP, Lead Developer), many other projects as programmer

* Took lead role of significant project and implemented a minimalist agile
  workflow leveraging DVCS, an issue tracker, and a QA cycle leading to much
  more robust software.
* Helped to create turnkey installer/updater for software product to reduce engineer
  time required to deploy software to hundreds of customers servers.
* Initiated and helped switch to DBIx::Class to promote code reuse and
  reduce dependence on SQL Server.
* Initiated and helped switch to Catalyst from CGI::Application to
  increase overall organization of projects in new projects.
* Initiated and helped switch to CGI::Application from cgi scripts to
  encourage modularity and reuse in older projects.
* Initiated and switched from IIS to
  Apache because of [serious perl interop
  issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/188896/why-does-iis-crash-when-i-print-to-stderr-in-perl).
